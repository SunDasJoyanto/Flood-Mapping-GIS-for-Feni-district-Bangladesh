# Flood-Mapping-GIS-for-Feni-district-Bangladesh
This flood risk analysis for Feni district used QGIS to assess flood vulnerability based on elevation, slope, land use, and proximity to streams. A final flood risk map was created with five categories. Three safest locations were identified. This methodology can be applied to other districts for better flood risk planning and management.
